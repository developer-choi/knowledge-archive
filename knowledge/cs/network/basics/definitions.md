## What’s the Network?
### Keywords
Node, Link, Protocol

### Official Answer
A network is a group of communicating [computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer) and [peripherals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral) known as [hosts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(network)), which [communicate data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_communication) to other hosts via [communication protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol).

> AI Annotation: 네트워크의 3요소는 다음과 같습니다.
> 1. **Node (Host)**: 데이터를 보내거나 받는 주체 (PC, 스마트폰, 서버 등).
> 2. **Link (Hardware)**: 데이터를 이동시키는 물리적/논리적 경로 (케이블, 라우터, 스위치).
> 3. **Protocol**: 통신 규칙 (TCP/IP, HTTP 등).
> 개발자로서 'Host'는 단순히 컴퓨터가 아니라, IP 주소를 가지고 양방향 통신이 가능한 네트워크 인터페이스를 가진 모든 장치를 의미합니다.
